There is a soft violence in being perceived online.

Pixels arrange themselves into something that resembles me,  
but never quite is.

I leave fragments here —  
half-thoughts, screenshots of feelings,  
sentences that glow briefly  
before dissolving into the feed.

The internet is not a mirror.  
It’s a lake at night.

You lean in,  
hoping to recognize yourself,  
and instead you see movement, distortion,  
something breathing underneath.

I don’t post to be understood.  
I post to **exist**.

To leave proof that I passed through this hour  
with trembling hands  
and a gentle, deliberate heart.

If you found this,  
it means the signal worked.
